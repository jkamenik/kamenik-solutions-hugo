The following are useful git tips and tricks.

## Cleanup to a given branch

Often times a git repo needs to be brought up-to-date with the remote quickly.  Using a feature branch style also means that branches need to be cleaned up as well.  The following does all that.

> [!INFO]
> If you copy the below into `git-cleanup` and put it in your path, then Git will automatically consider it a subcommand.  So within a git repo just run `git cleanup main` (note the space) will move your to the `main` branch, sync it with the remote, and delete any synced branches.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

branch="$1"
if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
    echo "No branch supplied, too dangerious to assume"
    exit 1
fi

set -u
git fetch -p
git checkout "$branch"
git pull

# shellcheck disable=SC2063 # we are looking for "*"
while IFS= read -r line; do
    git branch -d "$line" || echo "Unable to delete '$line', ignoring"
done < <(git branch | grep -v "^*" | awk '{print $1}' )
# Note: the line starting "*" is the current branch, ignore it
# try to safely delete the rest
```

## Find the hash of the latest commit

```bash
# If you know you are in the HEAD commit
git rev-parse HEAD

# or, one that works regardless
git log --pretty="oneline" | head -n1 | awk '{print $1}'
```

## Find the files that changed

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ This works if you have a stable ancestor branch.

</aside>

```bash
ANCESTOR="master"
COMMMIT="HEAD" # replace with commit hash if you could be in detached head

# sync the acenstor branche to ensure it has full history
git fetch origin "$ANCESTOR:remotes/origin/$ANCESTOR"

# diff to the anscestor
git diff --name-only "origin/$ACTIVE_BRANCH"..."$COMMIT"

# Unfortunately this doesn't catch if you are on $ACTIVE_BRANCH.
# So you need to check the the last commit if the above produces no output
git diff --name-only "$COMMIT^..$COMMIT"
```
