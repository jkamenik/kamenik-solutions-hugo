[Hashicorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) bills itself as an orchestration system that is easier then {{% wl "kubernetes" %}}.  While that is true there is less of a community, so your only option is Hashicorp commercial support.  It is a good platform to know, but your mileage may vary for production workloads.
