Microsoft has a long history of not taking security seriously.  In [February](https://www.spiceworks.com/it-security/vulnerability-management/news/azure-microsoft-exchange-servers-active-exploitation-hackers/) 2024 it was revealed that Azure has the biggest data breach back in 2023.  And for that reasons they have moved to `Hold` and unless you are already invested you should seriously consider changing providers.

Also, I question if they really are the #2 cloud provider by revenue.  At several incubators I know Azure provided hundreds of thousands of credits to each startup.  It was considered an investment so there were strings attached, but many of the startup did partake to the tune of 10s of thousands in cloud spend each month.  I believe this was how they got their revenue numbers; though I am no finance person.

In terms of actual infrastructure, there are similar concepts to the others.  Similar cost and similar performance.  And if you want Office 360, or Azure AD solution then you are locked in here.  Otherwise choose your cloud based on your needs.
