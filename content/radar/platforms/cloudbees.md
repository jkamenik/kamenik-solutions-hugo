All marketing aside, [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/) both provides a managed {{% wl Jenkins %}} solution as well as actively maintains Jenkins.  If you are in the Jenkins ecosystem already then this is basically your only serious option.  But, Jenkins has not kept up with the changes of the industry so it should be avoided if at all possible.
