[Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/) is an air-gapped {{% wl "Kubernetes" %}} installer.  If you live in that space then this is basically your only commercial option.  However, you aren't doing yourself any favors choosing Kubernetes.  Therefore, for the majority of users, this option should be avoided.
