In order to ensure credit is given we won't restate the manifesto here and instead redirect you to the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development.](https://agilemanifesto.org/).  The software industry as we know it owes much to this manifesto.

The single most important thing is that we are people trying to deliver value and get paid. Keep practices that make this easier and possible. Dispose of those that get in the way and learn from your mistakes. This should be adopted by all teams as the foundation for their processes.
