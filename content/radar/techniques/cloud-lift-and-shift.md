Cloud Lift and Shift was a term coined in the early days of the Cloud.  Companies wanted to migrate their datacenters to the cloud to lower cost, but they didn't want to change anything about their workloads.  This approach was largely unsuccessful at the time.

Currently, it has come to mean switching between similar services of the different cloud providers in a way to save cost.  Very commonly it is migrating workloads (stateful and stateless), databases, and files between the different clouds chasing cloud credits.  It is a losing game, and it is far better to lean into a {{% wl "Hybrid Cloud" %}} mentality where the effective workloads remain in the most effective cloud provider, and you bridge your cloud accounts securely.
