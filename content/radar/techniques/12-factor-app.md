The [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) methodology is designed for building SaaS services that are declarative, clean, maximally portable, and minimally divergent. By following these principles, the code becomes more portable, testable, and manageable in production, without being restricted by language, platform, or framework choice. All services should adhere to these principles.
