[Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) is a testing technique that places a higher emphasis on smaller, faster, and more isolated testing (i.e., unit testing).  It is the testing equivalent of shift-left and results in better overall quality and faster shipment.  It should be a key component of your testing strategy, if not the entire strategy.
