{{% wl "Scrum" %}} Story Points are probably the single biggest stumbling block for team members.  According to Scrum they shouldn't be related to hours, but should be related to how easy or hard something is.  Unfortunately, this concept can be challenging for many team members to grasp, so games like Planning Poker have to be adopted.

At its most basic, every one on the team gets a vote.  They vote with cards they pull from their hand.  Their hand is made up of Story Point cards for each valid set of points in the system being used.  Everyone shows their cards.  If the cards shown are all similar then the story is updated and folks move on.  If the cards are different then debate is done and another vote is had.  Continue until everything is scoped.

It is better than having no structure, but it doesn't scale well. In many cases, much of the debate will center around what a "point" actually means. Older tickets often have to be rescoped as the session moves forward. We are cautious about using this technique.

While not perfect we find that {{% wl "3 Point Estimate" "3 Point Estimation" %}} is usually a better solution to estimation.
