[Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module) is one of the more popular {{% wl "Agile Software Development" %}} techniques.  Interestingly enough it just {{% wl "Waterfall Software Development" %}} rebranded.  It is one of the few that you can purchase training and certification for, which should be your clue that Scrum really isn't agile in the strictest sense.  However, in comparison to other techniques like {{% wl "Six Sigma" %}} it is much lighter weight.  There are some good points which you should trial in whatever development lifecycle you use.

The good:

- Sprint Planning
- Scrum Team
- Definition of Done / Acceptance Criteria
- Retrospective

The bad:

- Daily Scrum / Standup
- Backlog Grooming
- Effort Estimation
- Burn-down Charts

The ugly:

- Infinite Backlog
- Sprints
- Moving Goal Posts / Crunch Culture
- "Full stack"
- Ceremonies

Most of the good part of Scrum are focused on the making sure the "team" knows what to do.  Most of the bad and ugly are the reality of keeping schedules with limited and imperfect information.  There is a balance to be had, but because Scrum has a lot of ceremonies some folks will start to value ceremonies those instead of delivering value.

One could have a perfect burn-down chart and still not ship a usable product.  Or one could have a completely unmanageable backlog and deliver values constantly.  Following Scrum does not guarantee results.  Instead it should be treated like a collection of light weight techniques that can be applied or ignored as needed.
