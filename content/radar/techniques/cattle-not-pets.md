This is an idea where once upon a time we treated servers like pets.  We gave them names, allowed them to become unique, and spend a lot of time caring for them individually.  This didn't scale so we increasing made the pets do more and more and it was catastrophic when they died.

Cattle on the other hand are numbered - not named, are identical to each other and told what to do, and are fungible and replaced when they fail.

Modern cloud based services only works and scale if you treat the underlying infrastructure as cattle.
