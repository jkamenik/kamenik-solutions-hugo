We are big fans of Hybrid Cloud, if and only if you do it correctly. The worst thing you can do is flop back and forth between similar services across clouds (also known as {{% wl "Cloud Lift and Shift" %}}). However, if you utilize the best of each cloud's offering and allow your developers to choose the ideal environment for their needs, then Hybrid Cloud can be a multiplier.

It is important that you bridge your Cloud accounts securely either via {{% wl "SDWAN" %}}, {{% wl "VPN Gateway" %}}, or {{% wl "Beyond Corp" %}}.
